		In terms of intimate relationships, Acts of Service is a language that can <br> best be described as doing something for your partner that you know they <br> would like, such as filling up their gas, watering their plants, or cooking <br> them a meal.
		<p> When you give Acts of Service, you give up your time. This non-verbal <br> form of love can be time-consuming and exhausting, but if it’s what your <br> partner needs, then it's worth the effort.

	If you have identified that your partner prefers to receive Acts of Service, then you’re one step closer to making your partner feel loved (and assuming you love your partner, you should want to make <br> them feel this way). Whether it’s in your nature to give Acts of Service, or not, know that anyone can learn this love language.
<p>
	When it comes to performing Acts of Service, here are four things you can do:
</font> </center>

<table border="0" cellpadding="10" align=center>
<tr>
	<td> <font color=purple size=4 face="corbel">
		1) Pay attention to the small things: what your partner wants to do on <br> your next trip together, how much sugar your partner adds to their <br> morning coffee, what time your partner’s favorite show is on, etc. <br> Take notes, if you can’t remember. <br>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td> <center> <img src="escort.gif"> </td>
	<td> <font color=purple size=4 face="corbel">
		2) Consider the things your partner doesn’t enjoy doing. If your <br> partner complains about taking out the trash, researching financial <br> terms, cleaning the space between the wall and the dresser, or <br> walking the dog, then you can do these tasks for your partner. If <br> your partner doesn’t like dealing with the cable company, offer to <br> take on responsibility for the monthly cable bill.
	</td> </font>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td> <font color=purple size=4 face="corbel">
		3) Focus on acts that are easy for you to accommodate into your <br> schedule. Pay attention to your partner’s calendar each week and <br> see if you can add in Acts of Service. Maybe your partner has limited <br> time between their workout in the morning and their first work <br> meeting. Plan to have coffee and breakfast ready and waiting.

</tr>
<tr>
	<td> <center> <img src="rain.gif"> </td>
	<td> <font color=purple size=4 face="corbel">
		4) Utilize your strengths. If you understand something your partner <br> doesn’t, offer your services. If you’re more handy than your <br> partner, for example, focus on handyman tasks like changing your <br> partner’s oil, or fixing the broken lightbulb in the bathroom.
