		When it comes to Gary Chapman's five love languages, words of <br> affirmation is the most common love language, edging out quality time and <br> acts of service. It also is the only love language that revolves around <br> verbal expression. <p>
		Words of affirmation are words that communicate your love, appreciation, <br> and respect for another person. They're positive words and phrases used <br> to uplift someone. What's more, these compliments and words of <br> encouragement don't have to be said directly to the person. A simple <br> hand-written note is appreciated just as much as a personal <br> phone call. <p>

		People who give and receive love through words of affirmation tend to be <br> the people who notice and care about the details of other people's lives. <br> For instance, they may be the first to notice their partner's new haircut. <br> They also remember to ask the neighbor how their sick dog is doing. They <br> may even remember to ask the cashier at the local supermarket if they are <br> feeling any better.
